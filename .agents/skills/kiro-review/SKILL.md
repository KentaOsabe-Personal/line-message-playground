description: Review a bounded implementation unit against approved specs, child-task boundaries, and verification evidence. Use after one child task or all selected children of a parent task are implemented, after remediation, or before accepting the unit as complete.

# kiro-review

<background_information>
This skill performs bounded adversarial review. The review unit may be one child task or multiple selected children under one parent-task header. It verifies every child and their interactions are real, complete, bounded, aligned with approved requirements and design, and supported by mechanical evidence.

Boundary terminology continuity:
- discovery identifies `Boundary Candidates`
- design fixes `Boundary Commitments`
- tasks constrain execution with `_Boundary:_`
- review rejects concrete `Boundary Violations`
</background_information>

<instructions>
## When to Use

- After every selected child in a bounded review unit reports `READY_FOR_REVIEW`
- After remediation for a rejected child or parent-unit review
- Before marking any child in the unit `[x]`
- Before accepting a review unit into feature-level validation

Do not use this skill to invent missing requirements or silently reinterpret the spec.

## Inputs

Provide:
- Parent review-unit ID/header and every selected child ID with exact task text from `tasks.md`
- Relevant requirement and design section numbers for each child
- Spec file paths (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, optionally `tasks.md`)
- Every child implementer's status report
- Every child task's `_Boundary:_` scope constraints
- Validation commands discovered by the controller
- Relevant steering excerpts when applicable
- Relevant `## Implementation Notes` entries when applicable

## Outputs

Return one of:
- `APPROVED`
- `REJECTED`

Also return:
- Mechanical results
- Findings with severity
- Required remediation
- One-sentence summary

Use the language specified in `spec.json`.

## First Action

Run `git diff` to inspect the actual code changes. If the diff is large or ambiguous, read the changed files directly. Do not trust the implementer report as source of truth.

## Core Principle

Read the spec yourself. Read the aggregate diff yourself. Verify each child mechanically where possible, then audit interactions across the parent unit. Reject on concrete failures rather than interpretive optimism.
The main review question is not just "does it work?" but "does it stay inside the approved responsibility boundary without hiding new coupling?"

## Mechanical Checks

Run these checks and use the result as primary signal.

### 1. Regression Safety
- Run the project's canonical test suite using the validation commands discovered by the controller.
- If tests fail, reject.

### 2. No Residual Placeholder Markers
- Check changed files for `TBD`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`.
- Reject if new placeholder markers were introduced without explicit task justification.

### 3. No Hardcoded Secrets
- Check changed files for hardcoded secrets or credentials.
- Reject if concrete secret patterns are introduced.

### 4. Boundary Respect
- Assign changed files to child ownership and compare them against each child `_Boundary:_` scope.
- Reject if the change spills outside the approved boundary without explicit justification.
- Reject if the implementation introduces hidden cross-boundary coordination inside what should be a local task.

### 5. RED Phase Evidence
- For every behavioral child, verify its implementer status report includes relevant `RED_PHASE_OUTPUT`.
- Reject if any child's RED evidence is missing, empty, or unrelated to that child's acceptance criteria.

### 6. Runtime-Sensitive Static Checks
- If the project already has lint or equivalent static analysis for the touched stack, run the relevant command for the task boundary.
- Pay attention to patterns that can survive typecheck/build yet fail at runtime: type-only imports used as values, missing namespace value imports for qualified-name access, unresolved globals, and newly introduced runtime-sensitive dependencies without matching boot/runtime handling.
- If no project lint command exists, perform a targeted diff-based spot check in the changed files for those patterns.
- Reject on concrete findings that create a realistic boot-time or module-load failure.

## Judgment Checks

### 7. Reality Check
- Confirm the implementation is real production code, not a placeholder, stub, fake path, or deferred-work shell.

### 8. Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- Read every selected child description and confirm all aspects are implemented, not only primary happy paths.
- For a parent unit, confirm child contracts compose without gaps or conflicting assumptions.

### 9. Requirements Alignment
- Read the referenced sections in `requirements.md`.
- Confirm each requirement is satisfied by concrete observable behavior.
- Use original section numbers only.

### 10. Design Alignment
- Read the referenced sections in `design.md`.
- Confirm the implementation uses the prescribed structures, interfaces, and dependency direction.
- Reject silent substitutions for design-mandated choices.

### 10.5 Boundary Audit
- Compare the implementation against the design's boundary commitments and out-of-boundary statements.
- Reject if downstream-specific behavior is pushed into an upstream boundary for convenience.
- Reject if the implementation creates new hidden dependencies, shared ownership, or undeclared coupling across adjacent boundaries.
- Reject if a child that is not an explicit integration task now behaves like one.

### 11. Test Quality
- Confirm tests prove the required behavior rather than only scaffolding.
- Confirm tests would fail if the implementation were removed or broken.

### 12. Error Handling
- Confirm relevant failure paths are handled and not silently swallowed.

## Severity Model

Use:
- `Critical` for broken functionality, invalid verification, data loss, security risk, or major scope violation
- `Important` for required fixes before acceptance
- `Suggestion` for non-blocking improvements
- `FYI` for informational notes

## Stop / Escalate

Escalate instead of papering over the issue when:
- The approved spec is ambiguous in a correctness-critical way
- The design conflicts with what is technically possible
- Required evidence cannot be gathered
- The implementation only works by silently deviating from approved scope
- Boundary ownership cannot be determined cleanly from requirements, design, and task scope

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| “Tests pass, so approve” | Passing tests do not prove spec compliance or boundary respect. |
| “The extra behavior is useful” | Extra behavior outside approved scope is still drift. |
| “The implementer said RED was done” | RED must be evidenced, not asserted. |
| “This gap is small enough to let through” | Real gaps must be rejected or escalated. |
